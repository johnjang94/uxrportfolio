## Project 1 | Redesigning an internal web-based communication portal for a telecommunication company

- This was a team-based and a real-world project
- Objective(s):
  <li>discover the pain points of the customers who use the portal service provided by this telecommunication company</li><br/>
  <li>provide some insights to the design team regarding how the new web architecture and the new UI should accommodate the customers</li>
  
- Mission Criteria:<br/>
  <li>recruit participants who have some level of experience in video-call communication via online</li><br/>
  <li>discover the advantages of using the current portal and find out anything that is inconvenient</li><br/>
  <li>take notes regarding the participants' suggestions</li>
  <li>summarize the findings and present the insights clearly to the design team and the stakeholders</li>

### Project 2 | Redesign a website for a travel insurance company

- This was a small project that I did myself
- Objective(s):
  <li>present the voices of the customers</li>
  <li>provide some insights to the design team regarding how the new web architecture and the new UI should accommodate the customers</li>
  
- Mission Criteria:<br/>
  <li>gather information regarding the complaints from the customers (i.e. what are the most commonly received complaints?)</li>
  <li>explore the website to understand the structure and the site map (i.e. how does it logically operate?)</li>
  <li>investigate if the new look and re-organized functionalities provide the intuitiveness and the convenience that the participants were seeking for </li>
