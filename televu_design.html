    <h1>Design</h1>
    <h3 class="consideration">Considerations - 3 points</h3>
    <p class="point">
      We have considered the following three points while we were coming up with
      new design for the client.
      <li>convenient based on frequent use</li>
      <span class="detail"
        >the features that are most frequently used should be well-spotted</span
      >
      <li>ease on navigation</li>
      <span class="detail"
        >it is important to remind the customers about what they can do as the
        next step</span
      >
      <li>interactivity</li>
      <span class="detail"
        >the product needs to be interactive. it should provide feedback after
        each action</span
      >
    </p>
    <h3 class="consideration">Branding & Style</h3>
    <p class="points">
      The brand tone for TeleVU Incorporation is agile, but it was clean and
      neat.<br />
      Therefore, we have been consistent with blue colour, which was the primary
      colour for the design, but we have also mixed with grey, red, and green as
      supplementary colours.

    <h3 class="consideration visual">Visual Drafts</h3>
    <p class="consideration process">
      We all drew initial sketch for every page of the web application
      individually based on the user flow to get a better sense of how they
      should look and feel. After then, we have merged the ideas based on the
      client's choice:
    </p>
    <h4>Changes in History menu</h4>
    <img
      src="../uxdportfolio/televu/images/design/sketch/history.jpg"
      alt="History sketch"
      class="changes"
    />
    <li>
      taking an input from the client, we have added the categories to make it
      more organized
    </li>
    <li>
      the client's customers wanted to reduce the time used to spent in looking
      for a particular file, so we have added a search engine called "filter &
      search"
    </li>
    <h4>Changes in Video-Conference session window</h4>
    <img
      src="../uxdportfolio/televu/images/design/sketch/video.jpg"
      alt="Video session window sketch"
      class="changes"
    />
    <li>
      the client did not like the empty spaces being disproportionate compared
      to the size of icon layouts and other screens for the participants
    </li>
    <li>
      the client asked us to utilize the empty white spaces and readjust the
      size of screen in the centre as enlarged as possible
    </li>
    <li>
      the client wanted a clear difference between the icons for the web
      application and the icons for the mobile remote-control; therefore, we
      have tried to make them as intuitive as possible while keeping the clear
      difference.
    </li>
    <h4>Changes in GlassVU web page</h4>
    <img
      src="../uxdportfolio/televu/images/design/sketch/glassvu.jpg"
      alt="GlassVU web page sketch"
      class="changes"
    />
    <li>
      we realized that the product is not interactive with the customers.<br />
      i.e. they find a designated person to call, but they do not understand
      when they can call the person <br />--- sometimes the call buttons are
      white not clickable, sometimes the buttons are green and clickable
    </li>
