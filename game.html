        How to Play:
        <li>
          if you guess a number that is lower than the generated number by the
          computer, the computer will display "Go Up" message on the screen. In
          that case, you need to guess higher number.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you guess a number that is higher than the generated number by the
          computer, the compute will display "Go Down" message on the screen. As
          you may be able to guess, you need to lower down your number.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you guess the number exactly as the computer has, you have won the
          game.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 1: you only get 5 chances</li>
        <li>
          Rule 2: you can only guess the numbers between 1 and 100. If you guess
          any number below 1 or above 100, the system will remind you the range
          of possible numbers
        </li>
        <li>Rule 3: you cannot guess a number that you've already guessed</li>
      </ul>
