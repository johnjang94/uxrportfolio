        This is how the original homepage looks like once you first arrive at

        travel insurance, blog, and claims for more information. You can also
        get more information about the company's affiliation programs with its
        partners and view more options from the hamburger menu at the end of top

    <h1>Context & Background</h1>
    <p>
      TuGo insurance company is a Canadian-owned corporation that offers
      financial assistance on medical coverage during trips or on car rentals.
      <br /><br />
      They mainly help Canadians, but they also offer assistance to
      international students or travelers under conditions depending on the
      circumstances.
      <br /><br />
      There were two major complaints among the customers:
      <li>
        it is difficult to find the contact page when they need to reach out to
        the company in an urgent situation
      </li>
      <li>
        it is not convenient that the customers need to send an email to the
        customer service in order to claim for a coverage
      </li>
    </p>
    <img

      class="portal insurance"

    <span style="margin-left: 380px">Insurance page</span>

    <span style="margin-left: 380px">Contact Us page</span>
    <span style="margin-left: 290px">About Us page</span>

    <p>
      Recently, many customers who have tried TuGo service raised issues
      regarding the process of claiming for the coverage, addressing how
      difficult and complicated it feels to go through. Hence, I have decided to
      modify the process.
    </p>
    <img
      src="../uxdportfolio/tugo/images/context/claims.jpg"
      alt="TuGo Claims web page"
      class="portal claims"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      The above picture is the capture of the "Claims" page where the customers
      can read instruction on how to file a claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customers get information regarding...
      <li>what it means to claim</li>
      <li>what documents they need to get them ready</li>
      <li>what they may be eligible to claim</li>
    </p>
    <img
      src="../uxdportfolio/tugo/images/context/contact.jpeg"
      alt="TuGo Contact Us web page"
      class="portal claims"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      The above picture is the capture of the "Contact Us" page where the
      customers can find the number for the customer service or the company's
      corresponding email to reach out to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the truth is...<br />
      the customers usually feel that it is
      <span class="challenge">hard to find</span> the contact information in the
      first place because it is hidden in <br />"About Us" menu and not many
      customers have expected to find the contact information from here.
    </p>
    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>
