    <h1>Hello! üëãüèº</h1>
    <p class="greeting">It is a pleasure to meet you!</p>
    <h3>My background</h3>
    <p>
      In terms of academic background, I have studied Psychology (and have taken
      some courses in Neuroscience) <br />when I was an undergraduate. Recently,
      I have completed a UX Design bootcamp and now I officially hold<br />
      a UX certificate from an accredited university in the local area here in
      Toronto, Ontario, Canada üá®üá¶.
      <br />
      <br />
      By understanding the human mind from the deep inside, I design a system
      that is appropriate, soothing, and accommodating to the needs in various
      environments including the digital.
    </p>
    <h3>Oh Canada! üá®üá¶</h3>
    <p>
      I am an ordinary Canadian who was raised in Maritimes, specifically in New
      Brunswick.<br />
      According to Statistics Canada, there are approximately just about more
      than 776,000 people live in this province as of 2019. I used to live in a
      small city called Fredericton, the capital of New Brunswick. <br />Except
      the primary, I finished all my secondary and post-secondary education here
      in the small city until 2017.

    <p class="explained">
      In 2017, I moved to here in Toronto --- it was meant to be a visit, but I
      ended up working as a receptionist.<br />
      It could have been a good position for me, but I didn't really enjoy the
      position back then.<br />
      <br />
      After leaving the job, I pursued my interested into the field of Education
      and have spent the next few years studying and working as a teacher ---
      until COVID-19 came out of nowhere.<br />
      <br />
      Things have become a lot tougher and I needed computer to continue
      teaching the students.<br />
      Eventually, this type of working environment has opened my eyes on user
      experience (really because I was always thinking about what I am using
      given tools to teach and how I should teach young students to make sure
      that they are staying engaged).<br />
      <br />
      This was the moment I thought that I want to pursue my career in the field
      of UX.<br /><br />
      In January 2022, I have enrolled myself to a UX Design bootcamp that is
      offered by one of the accredited university here in the local area. The
      program lasted the total of 8 months and I have spent last 2 months
      practicing the UX skills I learned while participating in a real-world
      practice case with other teammates from the program.
      <br /><br />
      Today, I hold an official UX Certificate while continuing the practice on
      my own.

    <h3>I ‚ù§Ô∏è traveling!</h3>
    <p>
      I have visited different places when I was...
      <li>an exchange-student</li>
      <li>a member in Scouts Canada</li>
      <li>a student in external credit program called "Explore"</li>
      <li>
        an educator / an instructor in another country as an ESL instructor
      </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, as you can see, I have travelled many places around the world. My
      story in travel is still being written.

      Time: November 2016<br />
      <br />
      I have been to SF, LA, Vegas, and SD before my visit to Mt. Katahdin.<br />
      I have been here twice and it was fun to climb up the mountain!

      Locationüìç Tate Modem, the UK<br />
      Time: May 2015<br />
      <br />
      This is one of the places that I have visited while I was in England for a
      month. Tate Modern is a type of museum where you can see all kind of art
      collections.<br /><br />

      In fact, the building itself now has become the landmark of London, UK. I
      dropped by this place along with London Eye, Big Ben, etc. during my stay
      in England.

      Time: July 2015<br />
      <br />
      I was at Sherbrooke for a month to study Intermediate level of French. My
      study trip happened after I finished the beginner course at university.<br />
      <br />
      Learning a new language was tough, but it was still fun to learn!

      Time: (I cannot remember üôÑ)<br />
      <br />
      This was my first visit to Ontario, Canada. I was camping at Ontario Lake
      with my fellow campers from Scouts Canada for a week.<br /><br />
      The nature was beautiful and all the activities that I have done were
      physically challenging --- which were great actually!

      Time: February 2020 ~ September 2021<br />
      <br />
      I was in Korea as an English instructor over a year and a half. Besides
      Seoul, I have been to other cities such as Ansan and Hwa-jeong. Korea is a
      beautiful country with so much dynamic products from food to fashion,
      cosmetic surgery, and trips.<br /><br />They offer top-notch level of
      convenience for internet, food delivery, and commute everywhere.
