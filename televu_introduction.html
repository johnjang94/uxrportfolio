        smartphone or your tablet / iPad on your Netflix account. This is the

        your tablet or iPad, and any of your smartphone devices.

        This is the menu where you can check all the previous video-calls that
        were made in your department. You can see how many calls were made
        during a week or a month as well as who called who. The history of you
        calling others or receiving the call will be also recorded in this call
        log.

        This is the separate window where you can participate in the calls. You
        can dial another person on the list from RemoteVU, which is intended for
        “connections”. Once you either call the designated person or accept a
        call from another person, you will be directed to this separate session
        window. In this window, you can see the patient from the big screen on
        the centre of the screen. The featured objective is a patient who needs
        the clinician's assistance, and it is the guardian who is taking care of
        the patients. You can also see who is participating in the session from
        the smaller screen sizes.

        The following are the changes we've made: we have coloured the menu as
        darker blue to give a clear contrast from the content we have kept the
        logo on the top to indicate its branding we have added a small mark to
        indicate the designated location of the user we have moved the setting
        button on the top-right, next to the designated location we have added
        the description of the page for each menu to explain what the user can
        do on each page we have distinguished each column to ensure smooth
        navigation we have added a QR code to make sure that the devices are
        well-seen and used

        setting on the menu and on the top of the portal we have applied the
        similar UI setting in terms of the menu description we have changed the
        graph about the usage from the linear graph to a segmented graph
        depending on use we have differentiated the history (underneath the
        graph) by adding more detail such as the identification of caller, the
        identification of participants, the duration of time for each calls,
        status of recording, and indication where the saved files can be found

        The following are the changes we've made: we have changed how the
        navigation bar appears to be: the navigation icon bar for the Desktop PC
        or Mac will appear at the bottom of the screen (following the industry
        convention) and the navigation icon bar to control the smart-glasses
        will appear in the left side of the centred display box. Basically, if
        the mouse does not hover around the biggest screen in this
        video-session, the separated buttons for the smart glasses will not
        appear. we have grouped the icons together and distributed them to
        either the left, the centre, and the right depending on its purpose we
        have utilized the blank white space as much as we can by re-sizing the
        participant screens.

    <h1>Context & Background</h1>
    <p>
      TeleVU Innovations Inc. is a privately-owned telecommunication corporation
      that connects the clinicians and the patients on a remote-basis to reduce
      the wait times and to offer improved medical assistance.
      <br /><br />
      TeleVU Innovations Inc. offers two different products that are connected
      to each other. One of them is the access to the desktop website that
      clinicians can use to treat patients remotely.
      <br /><br />
      On Desktop website, the customers can sign-up, cancel, call another
      customer who use the same program, initiate a video-call, record a
      video-call (while in session) or review the recorded videos in history.

    <p>
      The other product is the service in glasses which is wearable. This
      machine is usually provided to the guardians or nurses who can assist the
      patients.
      <br /><br />
      Similar to the Desktop website, the patient's guardian(s) or the
      nurse-in-charge can either dial or accept the call from clinicians who are
      calling them from the Desktop website.
