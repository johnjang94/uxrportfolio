      I started to be able to make a static web page that is reponsive.<br />
      I began from creating a hamburger menu.

      Once I have learnt how to create a static and responsive web page, I have
      challenged myself to create multiple webpages.<br />
      Thie mission objective for this task was that I wanted to be able to
      connect each page.

    <p class="whyflipcard">
      This was a small little challenge that I wanted to implement to my
      portfolio website as I thought that this was one of the common techniques
      to show design.<br />
      The above piece used to be implemented as a decoration part for
      assumptions section in my first real-world UX case called TeleVU.<br />
      Soon, I have realized that the design did not look as fashionable in the
      cards because there were too many and the sizes for each card was too
      big.<br /><br />

      I basically ended up making the flip cards smaller with condenced
      information for each picture.

      Challenge: make a book // Unsuccessful first attempt

    <p class="challengesucceeded">
      At first, I did not think about making a book in my case study because I
      was not sure where to implement the book. Soon after I was finishing up
      the writing part of my real-world case study, I learnt that there was just
      too much information to talk about from what lessons my UX teammates and I
      had from the research part.<br /><br />

      I did not want anyone to be scrolling down the screen endlessly, but I
      still felt that people needed to know what we've learnt.<br />
      This was the moment that I thought of making a book, which will contain
      lots of importance information but still taking less portion of the
      screen.
      <br /><br />

      Yes, it is true that it was even more challenge to understand how carousel
      works. It was a challenge because any part of coding is mis-typed or not
      being typed correctly, the book will not be functional. That's exactly
      what happened to me while I was focusing on my case study in the
      portfolio.<br /><br />

      It was a few hours later that I have successfully been able to open and
      close the book with the buttons obtained from 3rd party source. üòÑ

    <h2 class="issue">Question: what was the issue?</h2>
    <p class="issueconfigured">
      A: In the Script tag that I have placed in the corresponding HTML
      document, I forgot to add the computer term
      <span class="defer">"defer"</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="issueexplained">
      Example: <br /><br />
      The script tag that I used for the first book:
    </p>
    <img
      src="previous_projects/lessons/book1_lesson.png"
      alt="Previous Script Tag"
      class="book1scripttag"

    <img
      src="previous_projects/lessons/book2_changes.png"
      alt="Difference"
      class="book2scripttag"
    />
    <p class="thestruggle">
      Yes, it would have been fantastic if I was finished just after learning
      how to open and close the book.<br />
      No, I needed to implement the book into the HTML document.<br />
      It took me another while to implement those format into my actual
      portfolio.<br />
      Still, I have constantly tried to accommodate what I have learnt and I
      have finally implemented into my portfolio case.
    </p>
    <h2 class="thequestion">
      OK?<br />
      ...but why can I not see it on your portfolio case study anymore?
    </h2>
    <p class="theadvice">
      I have been speaking with one of mentors who is currently working as
      senior.<br />
      She advised me that the use of carousel may not be an exactly good idea to
      implement. üò≠

    <h2 class="nextup">Next Up</h2>
    <p class="nextupdescription">
      I am currently planning to implement the following card slide to "Insight"
      part of my portfolio.<br />
      Ever since I have been able to create a card slide in a separate HTML
      document, I wanted to copy the code and paste it in my original portfolio.
      Unfortunately, I have realized that it was not going to work the way I
      wanted it to be because the coding for the original portfolio files that I
      have did not seem to be compatible to how I created the card slide.<br/<br />
      Having said that, I am going to gradually transfer the codes from my
      original portfolio to the card slide to see if I can implement it
      properly.
