                  The following interview study was conducted to investigate the usability of TeleVU suite

                  the people who use the TeleVU corporationâ€™s products. Prior to the beginning phase of the
                  questionnaires, the participants were acknowledged regarding the purpose of the study which is to
                  learn the first impression of TeleVU iSee web portal, the overall user experience of navigation and
                  the use of provided menu of the web portal, and the overall user experience of built-in functions
                  during the video-call sessions. The aim of this study included some questions that identify
                  difficulties that people have encountered while using the applications and collecting open
                  suggestions to understand on where and how to improvise the structure or the layout if

        Usability testing and user interview

          Although actual end-user testing would be more accurate, we will conduct usability testing
          and user interview to gather qualitative data from participants as per client's preference.
          The product for this project is video conferencing tool, hence, qualitative data should be
          sufficient.

                  My team and I have learnt that the login process was not as
                  confusing to the clinicians who were interested in using the
                  service. In fact, the client offers tutorial to the customers
                  before the customers can practically use the service; therefore,
                  the clinicians understand how to login.<br /><br />
                  
                  On the other hand, the client's customers still did not like the
                  fact that the login was in two-steps. Basically, they felt that it
                  was not necessary to click the "Sign in with another organization"
                  button if they were still supposed to write their login id and
                  password in the following screen. They said that one-step login
                  process will do.

       We have reached the conclusion that the features that is most used needs to be located in a place of the web page screen where it is well-spotted.
      </li>
      <ol style="margin-top: 30px; color: blue;">Point 2 I Ease on Navigation</ol>
      <li style="width: 840px;">
        My team and I believed that it is important to remind the users regarding what they can do after they complete a task, especially if the task is a part of a series of actions.
      </li>
      <ol style="margin-top: 50px; color: blue;">Point 3 I Interactivity</ol>
      <li>
        The product needed to be interactive.
      </li>
      <p class="point3explained">
        For example, if a clinician clicks "call" button, the product should at least notify the clinician that it is loading the video-calling session.

        My teammates and I believed that all these changes will improve the way that the clinicians use the product and will make them feel pleased to use the features more frequently than the past.
        However, we needed to know that what we've intended was working as we've intended to be. In order to find out, we have decided to put it to a test.

      From the user-testing phase, we were confirmed that things were working as we have intended them to be, and we were very pleased to see the outcome.<br/>
      <br/>
      Looking back to this project, I feel thankful that we had a gentle client, but we still had many challenges.<br/><br/>

      One of the challenges was the research.<br/>
      It was not easy to recruit the participants as the majority were busy clinicians afterall, so we have ended up interviewing some medical students as well as the professionals.<br/><br/>

      Another challenge was the teamwork.<br/>
      Since we were all working asynchronously, we heavily relied on Figma, Google Spreadsheet, Google Excel, and Miro altogether to keep the updates for all of us.<br/><br/>

      The entire course-work demanded a huge amount of work in such short amount of time. <br/>On the other hand, I was very happy to see that a) the redesign worked out very well, b) my teammates and the client have understood the importance of the research, and c) I have learned some valuable designing tools such as Figma.

    <h1 class="finalnote">For the Next Step</h1>
    <p class="finalnote_points">
      If there is anything that I wish things were better:
    </p>
      <li class="finalnote_point_detail">
        I still feel that it was unfortunate for us to miss the chance to learn further regarding the client company's business structure.
      </li>
      <li class="finalnote_point_detail1">
        I still hope that he allows some tiny changes such as modifting the titles for videos that are saved to the history section after the users are finished with recording the session for the convenience of the users, if the client chooses to work with another team of designers in the next opportunity.
