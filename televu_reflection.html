    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      Looking back to this project, I am thankful that we had a gentle
      client.<br />
      Still, we had a few challenges that fought us:
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Research</h3>
    <p class="details">
      It was not easy to recruit participants for this case study as the
      majority were occupied with patients.<br />
      The team ended up also interviewing the medical interns who were also
      running in the field.
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Teamwork</h3>
    <p class="details">
      Since we were all working asynchronously, we heavily relied on tools such
      as Figma, Google Spreadsheet, Google Excel, and Miro altogether to keep up
      with the dates.
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Workload</h3>
    <p class="details">
      The amount of workload was overwhelming, but we were very happy to see
      that a. the redesign worked out very well, b. my teammates and the client
      have understood the importance of the research, and c. I have learned some
      valuable designing tools such as Figma.
    </p>
    <h1>For the Next Step</h1>
    <p>
      If there is anything that I wish that things were better:
      <li>
        I still feel that it was unfortunate for us to miss the chance to learn
        further regarding the client company's business structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        I still hope that he allows some tiny changes such as modifying the
        titles for videos that are saved to the history section after the users
        are finished with recording the session for the convenience of the
        users, if the client chooses to work with another team of designers in
        the next opportunity.
      </li>
    </p>
